# Security Policy

`xchain-encoder` takes an ACTION string, a set of UTXOs, and a public key, and returns an unsigned PSBT for the caller to sign and broadcast. It builds transactions that move real value: a flaw in encoding, PSBT construction, or fee calculation can produce a transaction that misdirects funds or encodes the wrong action. We treat reports seriously and respond fast.

If you've found a security issue, please **do not open a public issue or pull request**. Use the private channels below.

## How to report

### Preferred: GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting

Open a draft advisory at:

<https://github.com/XChain-platform/xchain-encoder/security/advisories/new>

This is the fastest path. The advisory is private until we publish it.

### Alternative: Email

Email **security@dankest.llc** with:

- A description of the issue and the threat it poses.
- Reproduction steps or a proof-of-concept (a crafted input, payload, or API call that triggers the bug).
- The affected version (see `CHANGELOG.md` and the version badge in `README.md`) and the network you tested against (mainnet / testnet / regtest, and which chain).
- Any patches or mitigations you'd like considered.

For sensitive reports, encrypt the email body to our PGP key. The fingerprint will be published alongside the first signed release artifact; until then, the email channel is acceptable for first contact and we will coordinate an encrypted exchange before you share proof-of-concept details.

We do not currently offer a paid bug bounty. We do offer public credit in release notes and the advisory itself, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Response timeline

| Stage | Target |
|---|---|
| Initial acknowledgement | within 72 hours |
| Triage + severity assignment | within 7 days |
| Fix or mitigation in master | within 30 days for high/critical, 90 days for lower severities |
| Coordinated public disclosure | up to 90 days from initial report, or sooner if a fix has shipped and operators are protected |

If we cannot meet a timeline, we will tell you why and propose a new one. We will not silently let a report age.

## Scope

### In scope

- ACTION encoding correctness across all four formats (OP_RETURN, P2SH, P2WSH, multisig): a wrong encoding silently produces an undecodable or misinterpreted transaction.
- PSBT construction: inputs, outputs, amounts, and change address handling; any path where the wrong inputs are selected or the wrong value reaches an output.
- Fee calculation and the fee-rate cap logic (`MAX_FEE_RATE_MULTIPLIER`, `MAX_FEE_RATE_KB`): a bypass could drain inputs into miner fee.
- The encoder HTTP JSON-RPC API (`npm run api`): injection, auth bypass, rate-limit bypass, or denial-of-service via crafted requests.
- The browser bundle (`dist/xchain_encoder.min.js`) produced by `npm run build`, including supply-chain integrity of that artifact.
- Any path where a malformed or adversarial input yields a valid-looking but wrong transaction (wrong recipient, wrong amount, wrong action).

### Out of scope

- How the caller signs or broadcasts the PSBT (that is the wallet's or caller's responsibility); we do not control signing.
- Vulnerabilities in the underlying coin nodes (`bitcoind` / `litecoind` / `dogecoind`); report those to their respective projects.
- Compromise of upstream npm dependencies (we mitigate via audit + review, but a backdoor in a dep is the dep author's incident, though we still want to hear about it).
- Misconfiguration of the operator's own network exposure (for example, binding the API to a public interface without a firewall or authentication).
- Attacks that require the operator's host credentials or shell access to the encoder host.
- The user's key management and signing environment.

If you are unsure, send the report anyway and we will tell you whether it falls in scope.

## What we ask

- Give us a reasonable window to fix before disclosing publicly. The 90-day ceiling is firm; earlier is fine once a fix has shipped and operators are protected.
- Test against `regtest` or `testnet` where possible (the `xchain-regtest-miner` plus a local stack make this easy). Mainnet proofs-of-concept are accepted but should be the minimum needed.
- Do not run automated scanners against shared XChain infrastructure in a way that would impact availability for other operators.
- Do not access data, or attempt to access data, beyond what is needed to demonstrate the issue.

---

## What we will do

- Confirm receipt within the SLA above.
- Keep you informed as triage and remediation proceed.
- Credit you in the advisory and `CHANGELOG.md` entry, on request.
- Coordinate a CVE assignment when the severity warrants it.
- Publish a post-fix advisory describing the issue, the fix, and the affected version range.

---

## Versions covered

We ship security fixes against the latest release on `master`. Older releases are unsupported. The current version is recorded in `CHANGELOG.md` and the badge in `README.md`.
